## Summary
The _Nice Damage - Refreshed_ addon empowers players to personalize their combat text by offering a wide range of font options for both self and other player's combat numbers.

## Features
- Customized Font options for Self
- Customized Font options for Others

## Tentative Roadmap
- Customizable Font Coloring
- Customizable Font Sizing 

These features are purely for making combat text more in-line with Blizzard's content.  The regular font doesn't feel to be in-line with World of Warcraft's graphics, and this addon provides a way for players to customize the text to better fit their playstyle.
